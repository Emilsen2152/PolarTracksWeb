        <p><strong>Bio:</strong>Hello, my name is Ingvar but I use Inso digitaly so its easier for people to say my name.
          In 2020 I started making a small game called "Train". This was the first step to what Polar Tracks later became. In 2022 I came back after a long break from roblox gaming, in this period I also met Emil whom I later became a good friend with. Today I reside in Fredrikstad and make Videos and such as a freelancer.</p>

        <p><strong>Language:</strong>Norwegian/English</p>
        <p><strong>Discord User:</strong> @eikehn</p>
        <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Hi, my name is Eike and I am one of the Group advisors at Polar Tracks. I do all sorts of things at Polar Tracks, from developing in-game content to fixing issues in the Discord server. I am Norwegian and have over 5 to 6 years of experience with Roblox Studio. My first game was called "Extra" and it was a grocery store game. I was originally invited by a friend to a Minecraft server called "mc-banen," however, it was later shut down and Polar Tracks was formed. I started as a developer and worked my way up to Head of Marketing. Eventually, I stepped down from the Head of Marketing position and after some time I became a Group Advisor. That's my story at Polar Tracks! Psst I'm also the owner of GoNordic</p>
